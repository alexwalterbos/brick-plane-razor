# mustache-nemesis

The epic battle of a small cannon against an insurmountable force of razors. Get as far as you can while beating as many razors as possible using their own weaknesses.

##Running mustache-nemesis

This requires the libraries `SOIL` and `glfw` to be installed. This can be done using your favorite package manager. On Windows these need to be installed separately and added to your build path. 
Running mustache-nemesis can be done by executing `./build.sh`. This creates `./brick-plane-scissors`; running this starts the game.

* `Space` to 'flap' your cannon
* `P` for pausing
